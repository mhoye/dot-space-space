# Dot-Space-Space

Derived from the DaveRandom's version of the [CloudToButt.xpi](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla/blob/master/CloudToButt.xpi?raw=true)

Which was in turn derived from the work of Steven Frank's [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) Chrome extension.


## Building

1. Download the code, open FireFox.
2. Click *Add-ons* from the *Tools* menu and select the *Extensions* tab.
3. Drag-and-drop the XPI file onto the page.
